# StockMaster Pro Authentication Fix Guide

This guide explains the fixes made to resolve the authentication issues in the StockMaster Pro application.

## Problem Overview

The application was encountering the following errors:

```
AttributeError: module 'jose.jwt' has no attribute 'InvalidAudienceError'
```

This error occurred because the `python-jose` library doesn't have the specific exception class that the code was trying to use. Additionally, there were issues with the token verification process being too strict.

## Fixes Implemented

We've made the following fixes to resolve these issues:

### 1. Fixed JWT Error Handling

Modified `backend/auth/supabase_auth.py` to replace `jwt.InvalidAudienceError` with the more generic `jwt.JWTError` exception that actually exists in the library.

### 2. Enhanced Token Verification

Updated `backend/auth/patched_token_verify.py` to implement a more robust token verification system:
- Added explicit development mode to bypass strict token verification
- Improved error handling during token verification
- Fixed the audience validation issue

### 3. Environment Configuration

Created/updated the `.env` file to include:
- `DEV_MODE=true` to enable development mode for token verification
- Default Supabase configuration settings (you'll need to replace these with your actual values)
- Flask secret key configuration

## How to Use

We've created several scripts to help manage and run the application:

### Fix JWT Errors

Run this script to fix the JWT-related errors in the authentication system:

```
python fix_jwt_errors.py
```

### Set Up Environment

Run this script to set up or update your environment configuration:

```
python setup_env.py
```

### Run the Application

Run this script to start the Flask application with the proper environment setup:

```
python run_app.py
```

## Production Considerations

While these fixes allow the application to work in development mode, for production you should:

1. Set `DEV_MODE=false` in your `.env` file once you have proper Supabase configuration
2. Ensure you have valid Supabase credentials (URL, API key, and service role key)
3. Configure proper JWT validation for production security

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that `DEV_MODE=true` is set in your `.env` file
2. Verify your Supabase configuration settings
3. Clear browser cookies and cache before testing
4. Check the server logs for detailed error messages
