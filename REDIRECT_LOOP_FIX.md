# StockMaster Pro: Fixing Infinite Redirect Loops

This document explains how to fix the "ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS" error that occurs in the StockMaster Pro application.

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing an infinite redirect loop between the login and dashboard pages, resulting in the browser error:

```
This page isn't working
127.0.0.1 redirected you too many times.
Try deleting your cookies.
ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS
```

This occurred because:
1. The middleware was redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page
2. The login page was redirecting back to the dashboard
3. The root route was redirecting to login instead of showing content

## Solution

We've implemented the following fixes:

### 1. Updated Middleware Logic

Modified `backend/middleware/supabase_middleware.py` to:
- Add more routes to the public routes list, including `/static/` and `/test/supabase`
- Improve the route checking logic with `any()` instead of multiple conditions
- Prevent redirect loops by adding checks for auth-related paths
- Add special handling to prevent redirection when already on auth pages

### 2. Fixed Root Route

Updated the root route (`/`) in `app.py` to:
- Check for authentication using Supabase token instead of session
- Show the landing page instead of redirecting when not authenticated
- This prevents the redirect loop by providing actual content

### 3. Updated Login Page

Modified the login route to:
- Check if the user is already authenticated before showing the login form
- Redirect to dashboard only when truly authenticated
- Prevent unnecessary redirects

## How to Apply the Fix

We've created a script that automatically applies all the necessary changes:

```
python fix_redirect_loop.py
```

This script:
1. Creates backups of the modified files
2. Updates the middleware logic
3. Fixes the root route handling
4. Modifies the login page behavior

After running the script, restart your Flask application:

```
python run_app.py
```

## Verifying the Fix

Once the fix is applied:
1. Clear your browser cookies and cache
2. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
3. You should see the landing page instead of a redirect error
4. Login should work normally now

## Technical Details

The key issue was that the redirect loop occurred because:
- Unauthenticated users were being redirected to login
- The login page was checking authentication in a different way
- This created a circular dependency between routes

By making the root route render actual content and ensuring login page doesn't redirect authenticated users, we break the loop while maintaining proper authentication.
