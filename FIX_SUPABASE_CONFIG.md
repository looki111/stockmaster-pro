# Fixing Supabase DNS Issues

The error message "DNS_PROBE_POSSIBLE" indicates that your browser can't connect to your Supabase project because the URL is incorrect or malformed.

## Problem Found
The issue is in your `.env` file where the `SUPABASE_KEY` is broken into multiple lines, which makes it invalid.

## How to Fix

1. Open your `.env` file in a text editor
2. Fix the SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_KEY by ensuring they are on single lines without any line breaks or extra characters

Your current configuration looks like:
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://mdxyafghptizcjrgurth.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im1keHlhZmdocHRpemNqcmd1cn
                                                                                                           n
RoIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MTU0NTI4MDAsImV4cCI6MjAzMTAyODgwMH0.Yx_9Yx_9Yx_9Yx_9Yx_9Yx_9Yx_9Yx_9Yx_9Yx
                                                                                                           x
_9
```

It should be fixed to:
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://mdxyafghptizcjrgurth.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im1keHlhZmdocHRpemNqcmd1cnRoIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MTU0NTI4MDAsImV4cCI6MjAzMTAyODgwMH0.Yx_9Yx_9Yx_9Yx_9Yx_9Yx_9Yx_9Yx_9Yx_9Yx_9
```

## Verify Your Supabase Project
1. Also verify that your Supabase project ID is correct: `mdxyafghptizcjrgurth`
2. If this is just a sample project ID, you need to replace it with your actual Supabase project ID from your Supabase dashboard.
3. Same for the API key - make sure it's your actual anon/public key from the Supabase dashboard.

## After Fixing
After fixing the configuration, try running your application again. The browser should now be able to connect to your Supabase project.
